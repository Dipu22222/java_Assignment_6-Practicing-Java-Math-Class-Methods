<br>
Java Math Class Practice
About This Repo:

This repo is my java practice work where I test the Math class methods.
Sir give us a code that had some errors and tell us to fix it and run it.
I fix it, run in my pc and write down 5 equations that I solved by using Math class.

 What I Did:

1. Fixed and run java code without error.
2. Used different math functions like sqrt, pow, tan, toRadians, etc.
3. Wrote everything in MS Word and also in my java practice notebook.
4. Took sample input and output screenshot.

 Equations I Solved:

1.Height of right triangle

2.Compound interest

3.Cartesian to polar convert

4.Distance between two points

5.Quadratic equation solver

 *Math Methods Used:

1.Math.sqrt()

2.Math.pow()

3.Math.tan()

4.Math.toRadians()

5.Math.atan()

6.Math.toDegrees()

7.Math.min()
